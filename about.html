    #codethroughsummer challenge
</div>

Help you stop procrastinating, and work on that side project you have been thinking about since quite some time. Learn, Code, Interact. Work isn’t boring, it’s working alone that is! It doesn’t matter if you are a student aiming to learn software development, or a professional looking to switch career or build your own side project, working in a community would not just help you become a better software engineer but a better Hooman! PS-Love dogs? Tell us, we’ll bring some along in our community meet. :)

### For professionals

We all realise that the world needs change now more than ever. Take Gandhi’s advice, be that change. Remember that billionaire startup idea you dreamt of? It’s time to start working on it.

### For students

Experimentation is the best way to learn. Reach out to us in case you require mentorship, we’ll help you build your own syllabus for the project you want to work on. In order to succeed, all you need to ensure is hard work and dedication, everything else we are there to help.

### Getting started
<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.6">
TL;DR The rules of the challenge are pretty simple:
<br><br>
    1) You have to code for atleast <b>one hour</b> everyday on your project throughout the summer.
<br><br>
2) The daily coding period does not include any time spent on watching tutorials or reading blogs online.
    <br><br>
    3) At the end of day, you have to tweet the progress you made with <b>#codethroughsummer</b> and <b>#communitytocode</b> hashtags.
<br><br>
4)  You are allowed to have no more than one cheat day in a week. If due to any reason, you are not able to code for at least one hour, be sure to tweet on what you preferred to spend your time on instead. :P
    <br><br>
5) At the end of the summer, we will showcase and promote all the amazing products built by us. There is also a surprise gift package for all those who complete the challenge successfully. \o/
    <br><br>
    Remember, this is not someone else's but your own initiative to work on something you are passionate about. This challenge is about developing consistency and dedication; the two most important qualities for a person to be successful.

    The timeline below is curated to help you work efficiently, but you can choose to curate your own according to the project you will be working on. Be sure to share the timeline you wish to follow with the community.
